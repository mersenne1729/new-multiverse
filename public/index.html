                    <p>A prediction of <strong> chaotic inflation </strong> is the existence of an infinite ergodic universe, which, being infinite, must contain Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions. Accordingly, an infinite universe will contain an infinite number of Hubble volumes, all having the same physical laws and physical constants. The theory is that if space and matter are infinite, there must eventually be repeats of our universe. And since we are all in the same sort of reality, all physical constants and rules are the same within all these universes. The assumptions of this theory is that a parallel universe similar to our own is on the edge of our universe, which is estimated to be 4x1024 meters in radius. Combining this number with probability mathematics, it is estimated that the nearest identical copy of you is 10 to the 1028 meters away. Continuing with the calculations, at 10 to the 10118 meters away is an entire universe identical to ours. The first thing you'll ask is how anyone even dreams of coming up with these numbers. Their calculations are based on quite simple mathematical concepts: If I have a set number of atoms, I can only have a finite number of possibilities before they begin to repeat themselves: If I expand this on a universe scale, and the estimate that our universe contains approximately 10118 particles, I get a box that is about the size of 2 to the 10118 meters across. This means that our universe repeats itself approximately every 10 to the 10,118 meters.

                    <p>In the <strong> chaotic inflation </strong> theory, a variant of the cosmic inflation theory, the multiverse or space as a whole is stretching and will continue doing so forever, but some regions of space stop stretching and form distinct bubbles (like gas pockets in a loaf of rising bread). Such bubbles are embryonic level I multiverses. As long as random fluctuations in this field occur, space continues to expand. When these fields lose some energy in certain regions, the expansion slows, and a cosmic bubble we call a universe is formed. By scrutinizing the physical properties of our own universe, we see that any change in the basic physical constants can drastically change what our universe could physically allow. In the diagram displayed on the right, if either of the physical constants we observe in our universe had been slightly higher or lower, life as we know it does not exist. It is then plausable to assume that there must be other types of universes out there that contain different constants that would have been defined during the creation of their level 2 multiverse bubbles.

                    <p>The Level 3 or sometimes referred to as <strong> Many Worlds</strong> multiverse has been the focal point of discussion in many circles of philosophy, yet it is the only level of parallel universes that does not add any new qualitative multiverses. Instead, the level 3 multiverse says that the universe as we perceive it is one of many superimpositions of the same universe. The existence of the level 3 multiverse is supported by quantum observations and apparent interference patterns seen in certain scientific experiments. The implications of the level 3 multiverse do not end with the idea that the we perceive only a fraction of the super-impositions of several possible outcomes of our own universe. This multiverse can also make us re-analyze how we perceive time. Since time is just a way of organizing how we perceive the reorganization of matter from one state to the next, it is possible to conceive that time is an illusion as we perceive a sequence of jumps from one universe to another. Instead of thinking our single universe is experiencing a change in time, it is also possible to think that our current perception of the universe can be explained as a particular sequence of universes in the level 3 multiverse. This is possible because with an infinite number of universes, there is guaranteed to be some universe that is the next logical progression of the current one, and the transition to that universe is what we perceive as time.

                    <p>Entirely distinct universes that may not even be connected to ours in any meaningful way and very likely have entirely different fundamental physical laws The level 4 multiverse opens the doors to the ultimate level of parallelism in reality. It allows for other universes to be governed different rules of physics and mathematical structures, and is beyond the scope of our perception of space-time. Mathematics itself is an abstract concept, and changing its rules means we need to think abstractly to consider the existence of a level 4 multiverse. However, one possible way of visualizing it is as so. Say our solar system was a universe. From third person standpoint, the mathematics and physical laws of our universe produce a universe with a ring like structure. If the mathematical structures were changed, this 'universe' may end up looking like one of the other alternatives. The level 4 multiverse arises when we realize that mathematical structures are abstract and immutable, existing outside of space and time. The level 4 multiverse brings symmetry our concept of reality, for if there are mathematical structures which make our universe, there must be other mathematical structures corresponding to other universes. The plausability of the level 4 multiverse will likely depend on the future discovery of a generic mathematical structure that is consistent with the universe as we know it. If this one structure exists and can define our current reality, then there must be some other form out there to define other universes. Tegmark argues that a Level III multiverse does not contain more possibilities in the Hubble volume than a Level I or Level II multiverse. In effect, all the different "worlds" created by "splits" in a Level III multiverse with the same physical constants can be found in some Hubble volume in a Level I multiverse. Tegmark writes that, "The only difference between Level I and Level III is where your doppelgängers reside. In Level I they live elsewhere in good old three-dimensional space. In Level III they live on another quantum branch in infinite-dimensional <strong>Hilbert space</strong>

                    <p>In Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schrödinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He said that, when his Nobel equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously". This is the earliest known reference to the multiverse. Max Tegmark set out a classification schemes for the various theoretical types of multiverse which is set out here. This has some interesting consequence for consciousness as encapsulation by concepts such a <strong> Boltzmann Brain </strong> hypothesis amounts others.
