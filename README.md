## Synopsis
Just a fun way for me to understand a littel more about programing. This project presents the multiverse theory, the mind-bending idea that there are many if not innumerable other universes beyond our own, featuring a *CORE* API, a leading open journal.

## Prototype

You can find a a (hopfuly) working prototype here => https://mersenne1729.github.io/new-multiverse/

## Technical

The site is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery with the backend made with Node.js. It makes use of a JSON call to the *CORE* Open Platform API to return the data. Webpack is used to take any modules with dependencies to generate static assets that represent those modules.
